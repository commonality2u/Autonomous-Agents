[Recursive Introspection: Teaching Language Model Agents How to Self-Improve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18219)

- RISE (Recursive IntroSpEction): iteratively sel-improve LLM responses through fine-tuning with RL.
- LLM loss is lower, when using multi-turn data compared instead of only the final answer. Works only for reasoning, not knowledge tasks.
- Indicates strongly, that Full online RL is feasible with RISE and using iterative self-training procedure (such as STaR), because RISE improves the LLM with 5-turns with/without oracle model. 
- Demonstrates, that LLMs can self-improve its own mistakes to beyond level of propietary models, when trained with RISE. The self-improvement continues up to 6 iterations, demonstrating lower loss. 
- RISE starts with turn 1, where only prompt is provided. In turn 2, the prompt, the original response and its feedback is provided to generate the turn 2 response. Majority voting is used to select the final response from multiple responses generated. Alternatively, oracle model can be used to assist, when such is available.
- Why self-improvement works? RISE is compared to diffusion models, where generation is refined step-by-step. Similarly LLMs may lack "capacity" to process the request, which RISE can help to refine. See the talk on this paper [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv8aTLthfhs).

- The policy is improved using APA (Advantage-induces Policy Alignment)- and fine-tuning with [STaR-technique](#star) for threee iterations using 100k correct trajectories. 
- APA is a Actor-Critic RL technique. It creates copy of the LLM used as value network to enhance policy in the LLM. Reward function reviews the length and correctness of the generated trajectory.

- Gecko: "SOTA level" text embeddings with 768-dimensions with 7x smaller embedding model compared to prior SOTA. Gecko embeddings with 256 dimensions all existting 768-dimension text embeddings in MTEB
- Gecko uses FRet (Few-shot Prompted Retrieval dataset)-fine tuning dataset: task description, input query, positive passage, negative passage.
- FRet generates with LLM the relevant task and query for a passage. The query and task are fed into a pre-trained embedding model to get neighbor passages. LLM scores them either as positive or negative passages.
- Original passage may not become relevant positive/negative passage. 
- I think the overall idea could work even as prompt-engineering technique, where original passage is sent to LLM to define query/task, generate positive/negative passage and finally use the query, task, positive, negative passage as basis of retrieval.

Action maker/Environmental agent keep interacting until task is completed. Requires manual screening after data is generated to ensure task logical consistency.

[Beyond A*: Better Planning with Transformers via Search Dynamics Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14083)

-  Searchformer: Transformer model outperforms A* search algorithm in planning.
-  Two step approach, where Transformer excels large action spaces and learns heuristics (strategies to guide search) from the training with the data.
- First step generates synthetic dataset: Imitate A* search by using A* search and recording compute and and optimal plan as text token sequences(task description, search tree dynamics, and final plan) with length of thousands of tokens. This dataset includes search dynamics of A* search itself. Train a Transformer model (Searchformer) to generate the text token sequences with optimal plan for a given task. This leads to a transformer model, which has the A* search coded in the model weights.
- Second step further trains Searchformer using Expert Iteration, which attempts to generate optimal plans to tasks with less steps in the optimal plan. The resulting model solves Sokoban puzzles with 27% less search steps, than A* search algorithm. The idea is to generalize the Transformer model into more generic search beyond A* search.

- Reviews LLM agents capability to align humans in terms of emotional states, when new events take place.
- LLM agent framework, where time series text memories are stored in graph database, which are summarized. As new events take place, the norm of the past episodic memories is combined with the current context.

[STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465)

- Introduces the concept: "Self-Taught Reasoner" (STaR) or *, where LLM improves its reasoning by learning from its own reasoning: model is asked to generate rationalizations to questions. If rationalization derives wrong answer to question, the rationalization is repeated by giving it as well the correct answer. All rationalizations leading to correct answer are used for fine-tuning the LLM model. This process is repeated and each iteration improves the LLMs capability of reasoning.
- The paper does not refer to Self-Recursive Learning, but we could argue it as an example of this process in the context of reasoning.

- This ability is another example of Self-Recursive Learning, altough its not integrated back as training data of the model.
- This paper as well identified the capability of LLMs to learn multiple tasks by having been only trained to predict the next word. See Jason Wei´s presentation included below, where he covers the "Massively Multi-task learning" of LLMs and I think it helps to gain better insight about LLMs, rather than thinking them as simply "statistical models".
